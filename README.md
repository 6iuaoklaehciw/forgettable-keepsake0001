You have to start somewhere. For many, that's the readme file.

Start

This repository will be going through various d3.js visualiztion tutorials.
I'll be adding my own comments in order to better understand what's going on if I need to.
Hopefully it will aid in my own understanding of what exactly is happening.
I don't think I'm necessarily aloof, but there are some aspects that I don't quite understand currently.
